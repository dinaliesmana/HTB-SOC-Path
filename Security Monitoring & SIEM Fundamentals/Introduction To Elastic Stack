# 🔍 Introduction to the Elastic Stack – HTB Academy

This section covers the **Elastic Stack** (formerly ELK Stack), its components, and how it can be used as a **SIEM solution** in a modern SOC environment.

---

## 🧱 What Is the Elastic Stack?

The Elastic Stack is a powerful open-source toolset developed by Elastic. It includes:
- **Elasticsearch** – A distributed search and analytics engine
- **Logstash** – A data processing pipeline for log ingestion and transformation
- **Kibana** – A visualization tool for searching and analyzing data
- **Beats** – Lightweight agents that collect and ship data

> Data Flow:
> **Beats** → **Logstash** → **Elasticsearch** → **Kibana**  
> or  
> **Beats** → **Elasticsearch** → **Kibana**

## ⚙️ Core Components

### 📦 Elasticsearch
- JSON-based search engine
- Stores, indexes, and analyzes data from various sources
- Supports complex queries and data correlation

### 🔄 Logstash
- Ingests and transforms log data from multiple sources
- Applies filters to enrich and normalize logs
- Sends processed data to Elasticsearch

### 📊 Kibana
- Front-end UI for searching, filtering, and visualizing Elasticsearch data
- Supports dashboards, graphs, tables, and time-series charts
- Primary interface for SOC analysts

### 📡 Beats
- Lightweight data shippers like Filebeat and Metricbeat
- Installed on endpoints to forward logs/metrics to Logstash or Elasticsearch

## 🛡️ Elastic Stack as a SIEM

The Elastic Stack can be used as a full-fledged **SIEM** to:
- Ingest logs from firewalls, endpoints, IDS/IPS, etc.
- Correlate and analyze security events
- Build detection rules and visual dashboards in Kibana
- Enable threat hunting and incident response

---

## 🔎 Kibana Query Language (KQL)

KQL is used to query data in Kibana:
```kql
event.code:4625 AND winlog.event_data.SubStatus:0xC0000072
This finds failed login attempts on disabled Windows accounts.


🔹 KQL Features
Field:value pairs
- Free text search
- Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)
- Comparison operators (:>, :<, :!)
- Wildcards & regex
- Date/time range filters (@timestamp)

🧠 ECS – Elastic Common Schema
ECS standardizes field names across sources, improving:
- Query simplicity
- Dashboard consistency
- Cross-source correlation
- Compatibility with Elastic tools (Security, Observability, ML)

✅ Summary
The Elastic Stack is a modular, flexible platform well-suited for SIEM use cases. Mastering its tools—especially Kibana and KQL—is critical for a SOC Analyst. As I continue my SOC journey, I’ll practice building dashboards, writing queries, and analyzing security logs using the Elastic Stack.
