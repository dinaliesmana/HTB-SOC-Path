## 🧭 Introduction
This module introduces the core phases of incident handling in a SOC. It emphasizes the importance of structured responses, communication, and documentation throughout the lifecycle of a security incident.

---

## 🔗 Incident Handling Cyber Kill Chain
- Understanding the attacker’s methodology via the Cyber Kill Chain.
- Identifying points where detection and intervention are most effective.
- Mapping attack stages (e.g., Reconnaissance, Exploitation, Exfiltration) to response actions.

---

## 🧩 The Incident Handling Process
- Aligns with NIST 800-61.
- Focused on minimizing damage, recovering quickly, and learning from every incident.
- Key stages: Preparation, Detection & Analysis, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Post-Incident Activity.

---

## 🌀 Incident Handling Process Overview
- Provides a high-level workflow of incident response.
- Shows dependencies between each phase.
- Introduces documentation and communication practices.

---

## 🛠️ Preparation Stage (Part 1)
- Building an incident response team (IRT).
- Defining roles and responsibilities.
- Developing and testing incident response policies and playbooks.

---

## 🧰 Preparation Stage (Part 2)
- Asset identification and risk classification.
- Setting up communication channels and escalation paths.
- Creating and maintaining baselines for detection.

---

## 🔍 Detection & Analysis Stage (Part 1)
- Collecting and triaging alerts/logs using tools like SIEM.
- Identifying anomalies and suspicious patterns.
- Initial validation and severity classification.

---

## 🧪 Detection & Analysis Stage (Part 2)
- Correlating evidence across logs, endpoints, and network.
- Investigating indicators of compromise (IOCs).
- Determining attack scope and timeline.

---

## 🔐 Containment, Eradication, & Recovery Stage
- Short-term and long-term containment strategies.
- Eradicating the root cause (e.g., malware, misconfigurations).
- Recovery: restoring systems to known-good states and monitoring for recurrence.

---

## 🧾 Post-Incident Activity Stage
- Conducting a **Lessons Learned** meeting.
- Updating documentation and improving playbooks.
- Reporting to stakeholders and possibly law enforcement.

---

## 💭 Reflections
This module taught me the importance of a well-documented, repeatable process to deal with incidents calmly and effectively. I now understand how each phase contributes to minimizing the impact of an attack and improving future responses.
